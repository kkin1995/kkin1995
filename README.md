## Hi there, I'm Karan ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ”­ About Me
I am a aspiring researcher from the city of Bangalore, India. With over a year of hands-on experience in developing innovative AI projects, I thrive on transforming problems into impactful, streamlined solutions. 

My research into Astrophysics stems from my MSc thesis and subsequent research project studying interstellar dust and its interactions with starlight. I have generalised a large part of the code and it can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/kkin1995/dust-modelling.git)

My journey into AI has been marked by the creation of two impactful proof-of-concept projects:

- [Pose Classification](https://github.com/kkin1995/pose-classification.git): Developed a machine learning model using TensorFlow for pose classification in telehealth consultations. This repository is a PoC using a yoga poses dataset from Kaggle.
- [Text to SQL RAG Project](https://github.com/kkin1995/ehr-text-to-sql-rag.git): Implemented a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) algorithm to enable seamless interaction with complex patient health data through NLP and SQL.

My long-term ambition is to carve out a niche in the interdisciplinary field where Astrophysics collides with AI. I am currently expanding my horizons not only in academic research but also in the technical concepts of ML.
